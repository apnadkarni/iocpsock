	* makefile.vc:
		new upload rule using Expect on FTP (I'm just sooo kewl!)

	* tclWinError.c:
		renamed the ITEM macro to CASE

	* tclWinError.c:
		Big cleanup using Tcl's STINGIFY macro.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* makefile.vc:
	* man.html:
	* tclWinError.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Tagged for 3.0a3 release.  Renamed the error commands and
		removed the "32" from them.

2006-10-08  davygrvy
	* man.html:
		more prose

	* iocpIntDecls.h:
	* iocpsock.decls:
		Changed sig of PostOverlappedRecv() to optionally post the
		buffer if WSARecv failed

	* iocpsockInt.h:
		defined snprintf in an ISO compatible manner

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Modified all calls to PostOverlappedRecv() to use the new
		signature.  Fixed numerous small issues regarding errors
		getting lost.  Fixed a problem with write errors not alerting
		to Tcl.

	* tclWinError.c:
	* ws2ipx.c:
	* ws2irda.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
	* ws2udp.c:

	* pb_iocpsock.png:
		everyone has to have a "powered by" banner :)

2006-10-01  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Huge bug in RepostRecvs() fixed.  Immediate errors returned by
		PostOverlappedRecv() were being lost!

2006-09-22  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* makefile.vc:
		Bumped up version number to 3.0a2

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Close detection bug fixed!  When a socket does not have a
		readable watch mask, and is in zero-byte recvmode, EOF is never
		 ever read in.  Unfortunetly, writes weren't returning errors
		directly.  They are now, thus close detection is now working.

	* ws2tcp.c:
		comments edited

	* dllmain.c:
		Removed link statement for ws2_32.lib as we are loading it
		dynamically, not statically

	* iocpsock.dsp:
		source list changes

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Found and fixed a logic bug in DoRecvBufMerge().  When the
		socket is in zero-byte recvmode and EOF came in, a replacement
		zero-byte WSARecv call had beed posted.  Tcl did correctly get
		EOF, but that replacement WSARecv wasn't needed.  It now sets
		the correct flag in the SocketInfo struct so it won't happen.

2006-09-17  davygrvy
	* rules.vc:
		updated from Tcl HEAD

	* makefile.vc:
		bug found in $(baselibs).  no need for ws2_32 as I dynamically
		load it at run-time.  No need for any libs, actually.

	* ws2irda.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Tcl_Win32ErrId() and Tcl_Win32ErrMsg now look at the result of
		GetLastError() and don't take args.  Iocp_MakeTcp4.. and
		IocpMakeTcp6.. merged into a single Iocp_MakeTcpClientChannel
		and use getpeername() to decide what address family the given
		socket belongs to.  man page took lots of new prose.

	* makefile.vc:
	* makefile.vc:
		dist target improved

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Remove IocpThreadActionProc entirely when TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4
		is not defined

	* ws2irda.c:
		Added new Iocp_IrdaDiscovery(), but is untested whilst I wait

		Fixed format of addr->irdaDeviceId so it is displayed similar
		to a MAC address (XX-XX-XX-XX)

	* ws2irda.c:
		Added implementation of DecodeIrdaSockaddr().

2005-03-23  davygrvy

	* final_report.txt:
		There's good info in here..  This should be saved.

2004-05-08  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
		We are now 3.0 alpha 0 because the fconfigures will change and
		become incompatible.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		OurDisonnectEx function should be spelled OurDisconnectEx

2004-05-07  davygrvy
	* tests/test_client.tcl:
		silly bug with the http callback repaired.

2004-05-06  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Corrected an error message to return a more exact condition of
		the failure.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		When/if the completion thread dies with an exception, call Tcl_Panic

2004-05-05  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_static.dsp:
		resource.h removed

	* dllmain.c:
		[iocp_stats] command now outputs html

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		partial reads now supported.  The old limit where the -buffersize couldn't be

		extension.

	* testme.cmd:
		more tunable for the user

	* tests/all.tcl:
		request the user to exit the test suite when done (UI friendly)

	* HttpdRead.c:

	* ws2tcp.c:
		QOS support is currently turned off.

	* tests/test_client.tcl:

		drop warning level to 3 from 4

2004-03-28  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Added FindProtocolInfo() to begin support for QoS.

2004-03-27  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		HandleIo() wasn't respecting an error of WSAENOBUFFS and falling into an
		infinite loop trying to overcome the system resource limit.  cap limits are now
		reduced.  If you ask for a -backlog beyond what the system can do, it will
		now accept that limit and keep dropping the cap to reach an equilibrium.

2004-03-25  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		very minor memory leak in IocpAcceptOne() repaired.

	* readme.txt:
		more new stuff that leads the iocpsock_2_0 tag, unfortunately.

2004-03-24  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Big bug in IocpInputProc() fixed.  Upon receiving the graceful
		close indication, I had forgotten to free the buffer.

	* readme.txt:
		edited for 2.0

2004-03-23  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Try a different order of things in IocpCloseProc

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		renamed the IocpAcceptInfo struct to AcceptInfo.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Fixed a big bug in FreeSocketInfo where popping the readyAccepts list
		freed for a BufferInfo* rather than an AcceptInfo*.  Still searching for a
		lost reference problem under a graceful close initiated by a peer...

2004-03-19  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Changing -recvburst bynamically from flow-controlled to burst
		mode doesn't seem to be acting correctly.

	* tests/socket2.test:
		socket2-3.1 added, but marked 'knownBug'.

2004-03-17  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		OurDisonnectEx must return FALSE with WSA_IO_PENDING, whoops..

2004-03-16  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		When setting -recvburst from 1 to a greater cap, the setOptionProc needs
		to queue a WSARecv to bump it out of flow-controled mode.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Fixed some lack of check for watch masks.  Efficiency is
		improving.

2004-03-14  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Now that SocketInfo is restricted to only ever one entry on readySockets,
		use a node in the struct itself and stop using dynamic ones.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		validated formatting such that no line are > 74 characters.  Changed my
		mind about how to close a non-stream socket in async mode (yet again).
		Made sure the -backlog server fconfigure isn't seen or accepted for non-
		server sockets.

	* tests/test_client.tcl:
	* tests/test_server.tcl:
		use new fconfigures

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		had some logic inversion in the Get/SetOptionProcs

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		PostOverlappedSend needs to return an error if over the sendcap value
		so the core can schedule a background flush.  Now does this.

	* tests/socket2.test:
		new test to verify we need to keep calling the readable handler
		until EOF is serviced (unfinshed)

2004-03-13  davygrvy
	* license.terms:
		"bitching rights" clause added

	* testme.cmd:
		grouped commands don't like comments.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		(IocpCloseProc): Should set flags to IOCP_CLOSABLE for non-stream
		sockets before issuing CancelIo() for the async style close.

2004-03-12  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		How do you async close a non-stream socket?  Trying CancelIo(), but
		untested as we don't support UDP.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		added CancelIo().. I think I need this

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		ref count problem solved.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Now properly initiates a graceful close and auto-destroys the SocketInfo ref
		correctly under async close rules

	* makefile.vc:
		aweful grepping logic rears its ugly head.

	* tests/socket2.test:
		async close behavior required for socket2-2.1

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Renamed infoPtr->ready to be infoPtr->markedReady so it's meaning is not
		mis-understood.  Remember that the WatchProc does the verify and that
		infoPtr->markedReady is just a statement of a known condition and is not
		absolute until the WatchProc is called.  I need a to research the core's
		UpdateInterest() call to make sure after Tcl_NotifyChannel calls the handlers
		that the core forces a verify through the WatchProc, if not, possible
		polling behavior will need to be forced.

	* ws2tcp.c:
		Now handles the Win2K getaddrinfo() problem for server sockets, too,
		asking for the "any" port.  I hate the bad IPv6 preview code for Win2K..
		It's buggy.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		DoReadChars() in generic/tclIO.c calls UpdateInterest() after calling
		IocpInputProc to verify through IocpWatchProc that the channel's
		ready state, therefore the TclZapNotifier call in IocpInputProc after the
		IocpLLPushFront was removed.  This was a false impression given to
		me by Klaus Suetterlin <robert@mpe.mpg.de> for which he was incorrect.
		
		Dude, I don't mind the code reveiw, but its rather impolite to place someone
		who is providing FREE software in a defensive position.  Wake up.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		fconfigure renames and new async close() behavior (NOT FINISHED
		YET)

	* testme.cmd:
		set defaults so they work in my environment.. hehe just me!

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Faked a DisconnectEx for Win2K/NT4.  Order may not be important, but we
		hope the order it comes into the completion routine has no bearing.

2004-02-12  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Removed TCL_WRITABLE from the ready mask.  A socket, if open, is
		ALWAYS writable..  overlapped-I/O to the rescue.  By being bound-less,
		memory limit issues may be discovered for sockets that write faster than
		the wire can return the buffers.  We should watch for this.  Performance
		is not free.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		In a recent conversation with someone about details of IOCP, I found an
		issue with the behavior in the burst detection.  Burst detection is bypassed
		when setting-up a newly connected or accepted socket.
		
		Conceptually, it only makes sense to use the third return value of WSARecv
		for burst detection only when _replacing_ overlapped calls.  It is quite natural
		that a single WSARecv call might return completed when setting-up a new
		socket for receiving.  Should save about 512 (non-paged) + 4096 bytes or so
		of memory per socket per extra buffer used when started.

2003-05-28  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Turned off the internal send buffers and raised the send conccurency
		count from 2 to 20.  Overlapped WSASends act like the internal buffers
		anyway.  Seems natural to turn off the internal ones as this will reduce
		memcpy operations by user our user buffers directly.

	* ws2tcp.c:
		Second CreateSocketAddress() call in CreateTcpSocket() wasn't needed.
		This was causing server sockets to fail when the address data that errored
		wasn't needed anyways.

	* iocpsock.h:
		200 is much better.  Worth testing on various systems to
		understand this more.

2003-05-08  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		some more accurate commentary.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Replaced three function pointers accidentally removed.  They
		aren't used yet anyways.

2003-05-03  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		A couple small bugs.  Nothing major that would impact usability.  AcceptEx
		that came back with WSA_OPERATION_ABORTED was being replaced.
		That was wrong, just absorb the used buffer and bail.  It also seems that a
		cancelled listening socket caused the posted AcceptEx calls to fail with
		WSAENOTSOCK.  Odd, it isn't documented to return this error.

2003-04-30  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Added ideas for how to do a channel transfer.  Will wait for
		the TIP to come around.

	* readme.txt:
		updated version

	* bits.txt:
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Yet again (but this is good), all bugs fixed.

2003-03-29  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		absolutely final edits for 1.0

2003-03-26  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_hilevel.c:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		final changes.  This is version 1.0, done.

2003-03-21  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Much harder...  As bullet proof as a tank.

	* iocpsock.h:
		matched to other source changes

2003-03-15  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Tried to add a socket recyclebin, but the complexity is a bit
		much for now.  Maybe later I'll add it.  Not now.

2003-03-14  davygrvy
	* bits.txt:
		just some test scripts.

2003-02-27  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Added a way to turn off/on burst detection for compiling while
		this is being studied

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		ANDing the ones compliment is not the same as XORing.  Silly me.
		
		Decided to do absolute closesocket in the DriverCloseProc instead of the
		delay/lazy close I was doing before.

2003-02-26  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		more better fixed than last fix for the Tcl_Close problem for
		when *we* are intiating the close.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		fixed error in last fix.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		problem closing sockets fixed.

		PostOverlappedRecv.

2003-02-19  davygrvy
	* readme.txt:
		set date.

	* iocpsock.h:
		master configs changed a bit.  Needs study to determine best
		load behavior.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		InitSockets) Initialize*SubSystem call missed when winsock
		loaded the 1.1 interface.

	* ws2tcp.c:
		Made sure ipv6 sockaddr was not used when getting localhost in
		passive lookup.

2003-02-17  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		small fix for the Oct`02 SDK's wspiapi.h.  It needed
		WSASetLastError, which the may`02 SDK didn't use.

	* readme.txt:
		added note about ipv6

	* ws2tcp.c:
		buffix in the hints.

	* dllmain.c:
		removed the puts to stderr on load.

	* iocpsock.dsp:
		rc file.

	* bits.txt:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		When more than one sockaddr is returned from getaddrinfo, 
		choose ipv4.  Only when specifically asking for ipv6 should we
		use it.

2003-02-16  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Protect IocpLLDestroy from a NULL.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:

		Added IocpLLGetCount() for safe access in IocpEventCheckProc().

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		better error checking calling PostOverlappedAccept().

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		PostOverlappedAccept() now reallocs the buffer to include the
		address space.  Address space is now the protocol specific size
		 which is good.  Calling PostOverlappedAccept with a buffer of
		zero now means don't receive with the accept.

	* dllmain.c:
		moved to v0.4

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Moved operations in HandleIo() to a switch inplace of the if
		else if/else if...

		wsaErrorTable2 wasn't large enough.  Filled the holes to get it
		right.

	* dllmain.c:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Now works under threads.  Yet another overly complex manner of
		asyncronous shutdown that needed to be traced to find the
		obscure code paths of fourth dimensional thinking that comes
		with the nature of the beast.  Yes, threads are beasty.

	* readme.txt:
		added bits about v0.4, done so far.

	* ws2ipx.c:
		all 5 types catagorized.

2003-02-14  davygrvy

		set proper timestamp to match the binary.

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose

	* hackersguide.txt:
		CompletionThread name changed to CompletionThreadProc

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose, again edited.

	* readme.txt:
		Moving to version 0.3

	* tclhttpd.patch.txt:
		new file

		Watchdog DOS thread turned on.

	* ws2tcp.c:
	* ws2udp.c:
		Do proper clean-up on errors.

	* ws2tcp.c:
		server sockets will add themselves to the global list of
		listening sockets.

	* bits.txt:
		scratchpad.

	* dllmain.c:
		write a load notice to stderr.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		When closing an infoPtr, we must pop itself off the global
		listening list, too.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		watchdog DOS thread almost ready to be turned on.

	* ws2udp.c:
		a scratchpad of ideas.

2003-02-12  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Added socket cleanup in FreeBufferObj() for when pending listening sockets
		come back with WSA_OPERATION_ABORTED.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		FreeBufferObj() needed to pop itself off any pending lists it
		may be on!

2003-02-11  davygrvy
	* hackersguide.txt:
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		WatchDogThread partially added, but not turned on, yet.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Pending accepts now stored in a linked-list.  Later when the watchdog
		thread is made, we can traverse the lists.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Removed llPendingSend member of the SocketInfo struct.  It wasn't needed.
		Winsock itself acts as the queue.
