First start in iocpsock_lolevel.c:InitializeIocpSubSystem().  The completion port
is created there along with the threads to service it.

Jump down to CompletionThread().  Each thread idles in GetQueuedCompletionStatus()
waiting for work.

Next look at HandleIo().  The guts are all here.  Unlike WSAAsyncSelect() where all
you'd get is a notice to read from an FD_READ, completion ports give you result of
the read operation in the buffer you handed it when the operation was posted.
