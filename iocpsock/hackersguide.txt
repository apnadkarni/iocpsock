First start in iocpsock_lolevel.c:InitializeIocpSubSystem().  The completion port
is created there along with the thread(s) to service it.

Jump down to CompletionThreadProc().  Each thread idles in GetQueuedCompletionStatus()
waiting for work.

Next look at HandleIo().  The guts are all there.  Unlike WSAAsyncSelect() where all
you'd get is a notice that you need to call recv() from an FD_READ, completion ports
give you result of the read operation in the buffer you handed it when the operation
was initially posted prior to the data coming in.
