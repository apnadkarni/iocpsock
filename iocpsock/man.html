<h1>IOCPSOCK version 3.0</h1>
<br/>
The <b>IOCPSOCK</b> extension contains two (2) commands provided to the interpreter:
<dl>
    <dt>socket2</dt>
    <dd>
	Has the exact syntax as the core's <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/1114"
	target="_workspot">socket</a> command, but operates under a different
	I/O model.  An IPv6 address can be used.  The different
	<a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/1469" target="_workspot">fconfigure</a>
	options are as follows:
	<p/>
	<dl>
	    <dt>-backlog</dt>
	    <dd>
		Sets (or gets) the pool count of AcceptEx calls on the
		listening socket.  Keep raising this if you are prone to
		many "peer disconnected" errors when starting to read
		from a new connection or when clients trying to connect
		are getting "connection refused" or "timeout" errors. The
		sky is the limit on this setting.  The only limit to be
		concerned about is available memory.  The calculation is
		~500 bytes * the backlog size of the non-paged pool will
		be reserved (ie. ~0.5 * 200 == ~100K of the non-paged
		pool).  The non-paged pool is a global resource and is
		limited to about 1/4 of the physical memory.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>-sendcap</dt>
	    <dd>
		Sets (or gets) the sending limit in terms of the count of
		concurrent WSASend operations allowed.  Think of this as a
		poor-man's throttle.  More means speedier, but the per
		socket resource limit is raised.  Use &quot;1&quot; for
		lowest resource usage (HTTPD) and about &quot;25&quot; or
		greater for highest performance (FTPD).  This option can be
		set for listening sockets and will be inherited to new
		connections.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>-recvmode</dt>
	    <dd>
		Sets (or gets) the receive mode and properties of the mode.
		Choices are &quot;<i>zero-byte</i>&quot;,
		&quot;<i>flow-controlled</i>&quot; or
		&quot;<i>burst-detection &lt;cap&gt;</i>&quot;.  This
		option can be set for listening sockets and will be
		inherited to new connections.
		<p/>
		<i>zero-byte</i> is the lowest in terms of resource
		usage per socket and is the default, but is not the
		speediest.  What's going on under-the-hood is a
		zero-byte receive buffer is used for the overlapped
		WSARecv call so it is only used as an alert for when
		the socket becomes readable.  When the call to read the
		socket comes in to the Tcl_DriverInputProc, a
		non-blocking, non-overlapped WSARecv call is made using
		the actual channel buffer as the write space.  This
		mode is best used with applications that have a high
		concurrent socket count (possibly over 50K), move small
		amounts of data and that will have a long life span.
		HTTPD is a good example where this mode would be
		helpful.
		<p/>
		<i>flow-controlled</i> is the &quot;normal&quot; mode
		that should be used for fast transfers.  Under-the-hood,
		this is &quot;by-the-book&quot; overlapped-I/O.  To
		start the socket &quot;listening&quot; for receives,
		WSARecv is called for overlapped operation with a
		pre-allocated buffer that is handed to the kernel.  For
		when the Tcl_DriverInputProc is called, the buffer is
		memcpy'd into the channel buffer, and a new overlapped
		WSARecv call is made with a new kernel buffer (same
		size as the channel buffer) to take the last ones place.
		<p/>
		<i>burst-detection</i> mode allows for additional reads
		behind the scenes and will increase the concurrent pool
		of outstanding WSARecv calls within the limits
		specified.  &lt;cap&gt; is the pool size limit.
		Overlapped-I/O has the ability to post numerous
		outstanding WSARecv calls to match the (instantanious)
		incoming load.  This mode should only be used for
		problematic networks that are &quot;bursty&quot; with
		regards to data flow.  One should not use this mode if
		resource usage is at a premium.  The pool count does
		not reduce once increased by load detection.
		<i>flow-controlled</i> is the better option until you
		know you can improve transfer performance with
		<i>burst-detection</i>.
		<p/>

	</dl>
    </dd>

    <dt>iocp_stats</dt>
    <dd>
	returns useful info about what's going on under the hood.
    </dd>

</dl>
The <b>IOCPSOCK</b> extension also exports the following C functions
through its own Stubs file (iocpstubXX.lib).  Like other Tcl extensions,
#include &quot;iocpsock.h&quot; from your code and set -D USE_IOCP_STUBS
in the compile.  Use a block like the following in your shell's Init()
function:
<pre>
#ifdef STATIC_BUILD
    Tcl_StaticPackage(interp, "Iocpsock", Iocpsock_Init, Iocpsock_SafeInit);
    if (Iocpsock_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
	return TCL_ERROR;
    }
#else
    if (Iocpsock_InitStubs(interp, "3.0", 0 /*exact*/) == TCL_ERROR) {
	return TCL_ERROR;
    }
#endif
</pre>

	Just like the core's

	but can fail and return a NULL Tcl_Channel.  When it does fail,

	<span class=name>Tcl_WinErrId</span> returns a machine-readable

	<span class=name>Tcl_WinError</span> returns a human-readable
