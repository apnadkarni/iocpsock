<h1>IOCPSOCK version 3.0</h1>
<br/>
The <b>IOCPSOCK</b> extension contains two (2) commands provided to the interpreter:
<dl>

    <dt>socket2</dt>
    <dd>
        Has the exact syntax as the core's <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/1114"
        target="_workspot">socket</a> command, but operates under a different
        I/O model.  An IPv6 address can be used.  The different
        <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/1469">fconfigure</a> options are as
        follows:<p/>
        <dl>
            <dt>-backlog</dt>
            <dd>
                Sets (or gets) the pool count of AcceptEx calls on the
                listening socket.  Keep raising this if you are prone to
                many "peer disconnected" errors when starting to read
                from a new connection or when clients trying to connect
                are getting "connection refused" or "timeout" errors. The
                sky is the limit on this setting.  The only limit to be
                concerned about is available memory.  The calculation is
                ~500 bytes * the backlog size of the non-paged pool will
                be reserved (ie. ~0.5 * 200 == ~100K of the non-paged
                pool).  The non-paged pool is a global resource and is
                limited to about 1/4 of the physical memory.
            </dd>
            <dt>-sendcap</dt>
            <dd>
                Sets (or gets) the limit in terms of the count of concurrent
                buffers allowed.  Think of this as a poor-man's throttle.
                More means speedier, but the per socket resource limit is
                raised.
            </dd>
            <dt>-recvmode</dt>
            <dd>
                Sets (or gets) the receive mode and properties of the mode.
                Choices are <i>zero-byte</i>, or <i>burst</i>. <i>zero-byte</i>
                is the lowest in terms of resource usage per socket, but
                is not the speediest.  <i>burst</i> mode allows for reads
                behind the scenes and will increase the concurrent pool
                to match the in-coming (instantanious) load within the
                limits specified.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </dd>

    <dt>iocp_stats</dt>
    <dd>
        returns useful info about what's going on under the hood.
    </dd>

</dl>
