	== Tagged iocpsock_0_5 ==

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		small fix for the Oct`02 SDK's wspiapi.h.  It needed
		WSASetLastError, which the may`02 SDK didn't use.

	* readme.txt:
		added notes on ipv6

	* dllmain.c:
		removed the puts to stderr on load.

	* iocpsock.rc:
	* resource.h:
		(new) resource files

	* iocpsock.dsp:
		rc file.

	* bits.txt:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		When more than one sockaddr is returned from getaddrinfo, 
		choose ipv4.  Only when specifically asking for ipv6 should we
		use it.

2003-02-16  davygrvy
	* readme.txt:
		made note of recent changes

	* readme.txt:
		slight mods.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		(HandleIo) only set addr_storage when it's going to be used.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Protect IocpLLDestroy from a NULL.

	* bits.txt:
	* iocpsock.dsp:
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Now supports ipv6

	* ws2irda.c:
		added some sample code for future reference.

	* readme.txt:
		speling

	* license.terms:
		new

	* iocpsock.h:
		Fixed most all C++ style comments.

2003-02-15  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Added IocpLLGetCount() for safe access in IocpEventCheckProc().

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		PostOverlappedAccept() now reallocs the buffer to include the
		address space.  Address space is now the protocol specific size
		 which is good.  Calling PostOverlappedAccept with a buffer of
		zero now means don't receive with the accept.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		better error checking calling PostOverlappedAccept().

	* ws2ipx.c:
		all 5 types catagorized.

	* readme.txt:
		added bits about v0.4, done so far.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		wsaErrorTable2 wasn't large enough.  Filled the holes to get it
		right.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Moved operations in HandleIo() to a switch inplace of the if
		else if/else if...

2003-02-15  davygrvy
	* dllmain.c:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Now works under threads.  Yet another overly complex manner of
		asyncronous shutdown that needed to be traced to find the
		obscure code paths of fourth dimensional thinking that comes
		with the nature of the beast.  Yes, threads are beasty.

2003-02-14  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		small error code changes that mean nothing in the big picture.

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose

	* tclhttpd.patch.txt:
		new file

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose, again edited.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		OP_ACCEPT logic in HandleIo changed to report a zero byte read, but only
		post another WSARecv when more than zero bytes -- just like OP_READ.

	* hackersguide.txt:
		CompletionThread name changed to CompletionThreadProc

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose, again.

	* ws2tcp.c:
	* ws2udp.c:
		Do proper clean-up on errors.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Watchdog DOS thread turned on.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Moved the critical section locks in the watchdog routine to just where it was
		needed.

	* ws2tcp.c:
		server sockets will add themselves to the global list of
		listening sockets.

	* ws2udp.c:
		a scratchpad of ideas.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		watchdog DOS thread almost ready to be turned on.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		When closing an infoPtr, we must pop itself off the global
		listening list, too.

	* dllmain.c:
		write a load notice to stderr.

	* bits.txt:
		scratchpad.

2003-02-12  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Added socket cleanup in FreeBufferObj() for when pending listening sockets
		come back with WSA_OPERATION_ABORTED.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		FreeBufferObj() needed to pop itself off any pending lists it
		may be on!

2003-02-11  davygrvy
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Pending accepts now stored in a linked-list.  Later when the watchdog
		thread is made, we can traverse the lists.

	* hackersguide.txt:
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		WatchDogThread partially added, but not turned on, yet.

	* ws2udp.c:
	* ws2vines.c:
		Removed DisconnectEx() from the WS2ProtocolData struct.  We won
		t be using it.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Removed llPendingSend member of the SocketInfo struct.  It wasn't needed.
		Winsock itself acts as the queue.

	* hackersguide.txt:
		new file

2003-02-10  daveg
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Added blocking connect().

	* dllmain.c:
	* readme.txt:
		moved version up to 0.2

	* ws2tcp.c:
		Double HandleIo() call following immediate ConnectEx() return
		fixed.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		More ConnectEx work.

		In a good state.  accept fires the accept proc in Tcl.  receives untested.  free
		buffer stack 1/2 implimented.  Tcl_DriverInputProc looks good, untested.
		Can't send yet.  Socket error handling needs to be addressed.
