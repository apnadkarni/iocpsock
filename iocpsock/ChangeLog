	* dllmain.c:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Now works under threads.  Yet another overly complex manner of
		asyncronous shutdown that needed to be traced to find the
		obscure code paths of fourth dimensional thinking that comes
		with the nature of the beast.  Yes, threads are beasty.

2003-02-14  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		small error code changes that mean nothing in the big picture.

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose

	* tclhttpd.patch.txt:
		new file

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose, again edited.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		OP_ACCEPT logic in HandleIo changed to report a zero byte read, but only
		post another WSARecv when more than zero bytes -- just like OP_READ.

	* hackersguide.txt:
		CompletionThread name changed to CompletionThreadProc

	* readme.txt:
		update the prose, again.

	* ws2tcp.c:
	* ws2udp.c:
		Do proper clean-up on errors.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Watchdog DOS thread turned on.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Moved the critical section locks in the watchdog routine to just where it was
		needed.

	* ws2tcp.c:
		server sockets will add themselves to the global list of
		listening sockets.

	* ws2udp.c:
		a scratchpad of ideas.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		watchdog DOS thread almost ready to be turned on.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		When closing an infoPtr, we must pop itself off the global
		listening list, too.

	* dllmain.c:
		write a load notice to stderr.

	* bits.txt:
		scratchpad.

2003-02-12  davygrvy
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Added socket cleanup in FreeBufferObj() for when pending listening sockets
		come back with WSA_OPERATION_ABORTED.

	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		FreeBufferObj() needed to pop itself off any pending lists it
		may be on!

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		Pending accepts now stored in a linked-list.  Later when the watchdog
		thread is made, we can traverse the lists.

	* hackersguide.txt:
	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		WatchDogThread partially added, but not turned on, yet.

	* ws2vines.c:
		Removed DisconnectEx() from the WS2ProtocolData struct.  We won
		t be using it.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
		Removed llPendingSend member of the SocketInfo struct.  It wasn't needed.
		Winsock itself acts as the queue.

	* hackersguide.txt:

	* ws2tcp.c:
		Added blocking connect().

	* dllmain.c:
	* readme.txt:
		moved version up to 0.2

	* ws2tcp.c:
		Double HandleIo() call following immediate ConnectEx() return
		fixed.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* readme.txt:
		SocketInfo clean-up now working properly.

	* iocpsock.h:
	* iocpsock_lolevel.c:
	* ws2tcp.c:
		More ConnectEx work.

		Can't send yet.  Socket error handling needs to be addressed.
